how accurate is the nlp solution?
over 95% - for standart classification

how long does it take to reach at least 90% accuracy?
with pre-trained - 1 week
with human in the loop (more complex) - weeks or months 


what amount of training data would be required to reach desirable accuracy levels?


how much will we have to clean our data for it to be used by your solution?
pre-processing the data on their side

what data types does it support? can it be any data type? i.e an image of a word document, cad files with text
alot of file types (images, text documents, emails)

what is your policy on training and retraining the models? (time)
there are some pre-trained models which come ready to go

real-time vs batch results?
both

how do you validate the results?
they have an automated way as well as a human in the loop (operations team) - they can create labels in house


are there humans in the loop? is it possible to add?
they have a human in the loop (data scientists)


is the solution plug and play?
yes - they have pre-built models


can the solution be customized according to my needs?
yes - they can create personalized solutions for us (like accepting new file types)


which parts can be customized? models, data pipelines etc
ML and pre-processing tools

is the nlp solution affordable at scale?


how well does the platform scale?
cloud-native approaches 

can i leverage my own resources into the solution? on prem, cloud etc
yes, cloud mainly

what are its integration capabilities?


how to you expose the endpoint of the solution? is it an API, website etc...
API, outlook plug-ins (not yet all capabilities are covered)

how do I maintain the infrastructure?


what resources will we need to implement your solution to it's full potential?


will you be providing continuous support? how will the solution be handed over to us?
